Used to imply de-prioritization, that causes the fragment to be omitted in the initial response, and delivered as a subsequent response afterward.

Arguments:
* `if: Boolean`
  * When `true` fragment may be deferred, if omitted defaults to `true`.
* `label: String`
  * A unique label across all `@defer` and `@stream` directives in an operation.
  * This `label` should be used by GraphQL clients to identify the data from patch responses and associate it with the correct fragment.
  * If provided, the GraphQL Server must add it to the payload.

This directive may be provided for a field of `List` type so that the backend can leverage technology such asynchronous iterators to provide a partial list in the initial response, and additional list items in subsequent responses.

* `label: String`

* `initialCount: Int`
  * The number of list items the server should return as part of the initial response.
