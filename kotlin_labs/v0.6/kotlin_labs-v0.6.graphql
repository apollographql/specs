Marks a field or variable definition as optional or required

    A selection set containing fields used to compute the cache key of an object.
    Nested selection sets are currently not supported. Order is important.

    Key fields can be defined on interfaces. In that case, the key fields apply to all sub-types and sub-types are not allowed to define their own key fields.
    If a type implements multiple interfaces with keyfields, the keyfields must match across all interfaces with keyfields.

    The key fields are automatically added to the operations by the compiler.
    Aliased key fields are not recognized and the compiler adds a non-aliased version of the field if that happens.
    If a type is queried through an interface/union, this may add fragments.

    For an example, this query:

    ```graphql
    query {
        product {
            price
        }
    }
    ```

    is turned into this one after compilation:

    ```graphql
    query {
        product {
            ... on Book {
                isbn
            }
            ... on Movie {
                id
