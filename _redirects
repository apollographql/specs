# The Netlify site URLs are of a known shape, based on the branches of the
# GitHub repository that they are connected to:
#
# Example:
#   https://{normalized-branch-name}--{netlify-site-name}.netlify.app/
#
#  normalized-branch-name: converts dots to dashes, and other transforms.
#  netlify-site-name: the name defined in the Netlify UI's General settings.
